# BlenderAIMocap

Project from 2020 during Grade 11

In this project, I wanted to use AI for mocap in blender without having to wear a suit. The AI used was MEDIAPIPELINE ML POSE DETECTION
Sadly the Ai didnt support accurate enough depth detection, so I resorted to using Epipolar Geometry in OpenCV to manually calculate depth but ran into some errors. So the project was put on hold. May continue development in future
